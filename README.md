**A content-based wine recommendation system using professional tasting descriptions.**

How to build a system that would help tailor wine recommendations to users?

The proposed solution is a content-based wine recommendation system using professional tasting descriptions. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the information contained in the descriptions. The system will base its recommendation on one selected (liked) wine description or on one set of word describing the desired taste.

The project is presented, commented and discussed in this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tCcIGw24lLizHxUUMnMihTvOzKZYvRUpyS5TRDJtqBU/edit?usp=sharing).

[This notebook](https://github.com/de-la-viz/winerec/blob/master/code/WriteUp.ipynb) contains the code for building the recommendation system and presents the different steps and the process.
